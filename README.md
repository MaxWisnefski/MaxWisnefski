## Hi! My name is Maximilian Wisnefski (I go by Max)

I am currently a senior at Denison University. I plan to graduate with a major in Data Analytics and a double minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. 

During summer 2023, I collaborated with Denison faculty member Dr. Sarah R. Supp on an ongoing NSF funded research project. I used crowdsourced bird occurrence data to study the migration patterns of avian seed dispersers. Specifically, I was working with 15 years of data concerning 15 bird species that might be contributing to the spread of the eastern redcedar (<em>Juniperus virginiana</em>).

During fall 2023, I completed an independent research project, where I webscraped and analyzed 40 years of data from the [Internet Broadway Database](https://www.ibdb.com/) to elucidate the relationship between Tony Award outcomes and the success of individual Broadway productions. I was particularly interested in discovering the extent to which this relationship has changed over the last 40 years (if at all).
