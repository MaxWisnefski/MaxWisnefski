## Hi! My name is Maximilian Wisnefski (I go by Max)

I am currently a senior at Denison University. I plan to graduate with a major in Data Analytics and a double minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. 

During summer 2023, I collaborated with Denison faculty member Dr. Sarah R. Supp on an ongoing NSF funded research project. I used crowdsourced bird occurrence data to study the migration patterns of avian seed dispersers. Specifically, I was working with 15 years of data concerning 15 bird species that might be contributing to the spread of the eastern redcedar (<em>juniperus virginiana</em>).

Some of my interests include:
- :performing_arts: Theatre
- :musical_score: Music
- :open_book: sci-fi / fantasy novels
