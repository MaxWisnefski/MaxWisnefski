## Hi! My name is Maximilian Wisnefski (I go by Max)

I am a Denison University alum, class of 2024. I majored in Data Analytics and double minored in Computer Science and Philosophy. Now I work in Columbus, OH for Westinghouse Outdoor Power Equipment as their Business Systems Integration Analyst. 

During summer 2023, I collaborated with Denison faculty member Dr. Sarah R. Supp on an ongoing NSF funded research project. I used crowdsourced bird occurrence data to study the migration patterns of avian seed dispersers. Specifically, I was working with 15 years of data concerning 15 bird species that might be contributing to the spread of the eastern redcedar (<em>Juniperus virginiana</em>). [See here](https://github.com/sarahsupp/ERC-bird-dispersal)

During fall 2023, I completed an independent research project, where I webscraped and analyzed 40 years of data from the [Internet Broadway Database](https://www.ibdb.com/) to elucidate the relationship between Tony Award outcomes and the success of individual Broadway productions. I was particularly interested in examining the extent to which this relationship has changed over the last 40 years (if at all). [See here](https://github.com/MaxWisnefski/Tony-Award-Data-Analysis). I was honored to have this work recognized by the American Statistical Associationâ€™s [Undergraduate Research Project Competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2023/fall/winners), a national competition for research projects conducted by undergrad statistics and data science students.

Some of my hobbies/interests include:

- :open_book: sci-fi / fantasy novels (my favorite book is Dune by Frank Herbert)
